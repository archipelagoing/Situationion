Characterizing a Latent Situation-Modeling Regime in Transformer Mid-Layers

THESIS-----------------
Intermediate transformer layers exhibit a stable, relational representational regime that assembles and maintains transient situation models, observable through geometric invariants and sensitivity to constraint perturbations.

This was initially meant to be my final project for a class in grad school, but to be honest, the scope was much farther than I could reach, I got very overwhelmed, and I got very confused with how to proceed. 

I am trying again because it is very dear to me, and I cannot stop thinking about it, and I think there might be reason and use to it. I hope it is as helpful and useful and kind as I would like it to be :))
